- don't remember where i get it but works just fine - "hacked" noads skins for AcePlayer, simply copy and overide them in ...\user\Application Data\ACEStream\player  folder. But just let you know it may choked player functionality and prevent it from playing actial video in some cases , i was using portable vertion of browser which works much more stable with this "noads hacks".
